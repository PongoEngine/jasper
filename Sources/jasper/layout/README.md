Layout
=================

Warning! The Layout is purely conceptual. 

The goal the layout manager is to be simple, framework agnostic, and fast. The manager is in
the pre-alpha phase so the API is the first priority but once it 'feels' good more time will
be spent in optimizations.

Feel free to make recommendations to the API. Just be sure to keep in mind the three goals
- Simple
- Framework Agnostic
- Fast
